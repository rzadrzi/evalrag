"""
Evaluation of RAG system has tow main parts:
1. Component wise:
    1. Retrieval:
        1. Context Recall
        2. Context Percision
    
    2. Generation:
        1. Faithfulness
        2. Answer Relevancy

        
2. End to End:
    1. Answer Semantic Similarity
    2. Answer Correctness

    
"""

"""
Steps to evaluate RAG:
    1. An evaluation dataset with question - answer couples (QA couples):
        The evaluation dataset will be synthetically generated by an LLM 🤖, and questions will be filtered out by other LLMs 🤖
    2. An evaluator to compute the accuracy of our system on the above evaluation dataset:
        An LLM-as-a-judge agent 🤖 will then perform the evaluation on this synthetic dataset.

    Evaluation helper for assessing RAG answers.

    Typical usage:
